# [Maya Foundation website](http://foundation.jonlauridsen.com)

With Maya Foundation it's easy to configure Autodesk Maya to load scripts from any folder so you can focus on writing code.

##Starting from scratch?
Maybe you're just getting to the point where a couple custom scripts would really make a big difference for everyone at your company. With Foundation's simple interface it's easy for everyone to load the scripts you'll be writing.

## Experts can party too
Maybe you're already supporting a whole ecosystem of scripts but activating them involves old shell commands and wiki pages no one bothers to read. With Foundation's clean startup routines you can add a level of stability to your tool chain.
